(make a derived mode for Text DocView for academician for the
 text of its books.  Add the keybinding for quotation to it.  Fix
 the functions for getting title to work for this as well.)

(implement a function that after running doc-view-open-text, can
 be a key sequence to return to the image based pdf)

(write a function that given a search regex or string can search
 through the pdf text and cycle through matching pages along with
 snippets to identify where in the text it is. obviously use the
 clear page analysis stuff)

(check out google scholar)

(we want to do a few things here - first is analyze these papers)

(then we want to turn them into code)
